# Intro
Muliwai (pronounced: mu-lee-why, meaning river in Hawaiian) is a library for text pre-processing, augmentation, anonymization, and synthesis. It is intended to be used to process text datasets for training NLP models.

# What is it
Muliwai was written in part to support the privacy data-tooling efforts of the BigScience workshop, but has grown beyond this. There are several utilities for performing NER and assocaited augmentation and anonymization. In theory, Muliwai can do NER in most of the languages supported by XLMRoberta & M2M100 (100+ languages). However, we have not tested various languages beyond: ar, ur, bn, hi, eu, ca, vi, zh, fr, id, es, pt,  sw, yo. 

There are other features, and we will create documentation soon...

# How it works
We use a transformer NER model that is good enough for the current language - in this case, a specific model for the language, or a model with some cross-lingual capabilities. Muliwai tags using the transformer, then translates the sentence to a target_lang (e.g., English), and tests to see if the translation preserves the NER tagging, and discoutns or increases the weight of an NER decision accordingly. It then performs NER in the target_lang, and back translates to the src_lang. It then matches the translate sentence to the original sentence, to determine which text spans in the *original* src_lang sentence should be NER tagged based on the target_lang NER.

We also use spacy and regex as added signals for NER tags.

# What it's meant for
The translation techniques used are very compute heavy, and not intended to perform fast detection or anonymization of a dataset. Instead, it is intended to be used to create augmented training data to train a relatively fast model (e.g., spacy or transformer model) for languages where there is little or no NER data.

# Installing
If you want to be able to do gender detection and coref detection, you will need to load neuralcoref below. However, you will only be able to use spacy english if you load neural coref. You can also load a larger spacy model for more accuracy but more memory.
```
git clone https://github.com/ontocord/muliwai
pip install https://github.com/kpu/kenlm/archive/master.zip
pip install spacy==2.1.0 dateparser python-stdnum protobuf neuralcoref cdifflib transformers datasets langid faker sentencepiece fsspec tqdm sentence-transformers nltk
python -m nltk.downloader punkt wordnet
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

If you don't need gender detection and coref detection, install the below which will enable spacy for other languages. Neuralcoref will not be installed. You can also load a larger spacy model for more accuracy but more memory.
```
git clone https://github.com/ontocord/muliwai
pip install https://github.com/kpu/kenlm/archive/master.zip
pip install spacy==3.1.0 dateparser python-stdnum protobuf cdifflib transformers datasets langid faker sentencepiece fsspec tqdm sentence-transformers nltk tokenizers==0.11.3
python -m nltk.downloader punkt wordnet
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m spacy download fr_core_news_sm
python -m spacy download ca_core_news_sm
python -m spacy download pt_core_news_sm
python -m spacy download zh_core_web_sm

```
# Running
If no filenames are passed, the sample data from turkunlp_data/{src_lang}.jsonl.gz will be loaded. The below runs on a sample of 30 documents only.
```
cd muliwai
python process.py -src_lang zh -cutoff 30
```
If you have more than one GPU
```
cd muliwai
python process.py -src_lang zh -num_workers=2 -cutoff 30
```
# CLI
```

# Preloading the cache
- For systems where there is limited access to the Internet, such as the JZ supercomptuers, you will want to preload the models.
- The below command will load the various models needed to run the code for the specific language. 
- The huggingface models will be stored in ~/.cache/huggingface and ~/.cache/transformers.
- The neuralcoref cache is stored in ~/.neuralcoref
- NOTE: the nlkt_data and en_core_web_sm are not stored in ~/.cache directory and will vary based on your system. See the documentation for spacy and nltk for their location.
```
cd muliwai
python processor.py -src_lang zh -preload_cache
